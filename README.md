Solutions to CTF competitions

I want to qualify for DEFCON next year so this repo is to keep myself motivated and consistent with write-ups.
Some will be done after the actual CTFs since there aren't enough CTFs in a year and if I'm serious about
qualifying, I will need all the material I can get my hands on.
